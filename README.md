# augustcats' divine bootloader
esoteric booting into divinely-inspired OS.

## How to use
The bootloader should work as any other does. You tell the BIOS to boot into it. It doesn't actually boot *into* anything yet, so maybe don't run on real hardware. I'd test with QEmu using the provided binary.
